## Project description

Vengeance is a short thriller/mystery film directed and written by the talented students of NYUAD: Katie Ferreol, Usman Ali, Zunair Viqar. The film revolves around a popular highschool kid and his group of friends, who are being harrassed and haunted by an anonymous cyber-bully. As the events unfold, the identity of the anonymous hacker is revealed along with his malicious intent of taking revenge for what was done to him in the past.
High school student Zunair Viqar commits suicide after his ex-bestfriend uploads a video of Zunair bullying him one year ago, and the video shatters his reputation and dignity. To find out what really happened and the events that led to Zunair's suicide, the film jumps back when it all started with a truth and dare game. The game started with Zunair explaining the rules of the game and other friends joining the game with the host of the game as a "supposedly" AI robot. But after an absurd dare given to Usman by the robot, all other friend left except Zunair's close friends. As the game proceeded, it got scary and creepy with the surveillance footage as the robot hacks into the webcams of their electronic devices. The person controlling the robot reveals himself as he clarifies his intents to gain closure and get revenge of what Zunair did to him in the past by leaking the bullying video over social media. This destroys Zunair's character and status over social media as his friends condemn him for his actions and he gets suspended from school. The story signifies the importance of social status on social media platforms, as Zunair succumbs to suicide after the video ruined his reputation and the status as "Mr.Perfect" of the school.
